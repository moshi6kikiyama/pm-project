      Hiking is a wonderful way to immerse yourself in the outdoors. Transported by your own two feet and carrying only what you need for the day on your back, you can discover the
      beauty of nature at whatever pace you're comfortable with. And, with a little planning and preparation, it's an activity that almost anyone can do.
